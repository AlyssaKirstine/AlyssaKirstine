## Hi there 👋
I'm Alyssa. I'm a frontend developer and designer based in Cleveland, Ohio.
I primarily build headless marketing websites. I'm obsessed with pixel-perfect design and scalable content management systems.

### 👩🏽‍💻 Technologies I use:
- React
- Next.js
- Sanity
- ... and so many more. This is just my go-to tech stack these days :)

### 🤓 I make websites. Hire me.
*I'm biased, but the companies I work with are the best.*

### 🪴 Hobbies. I can be fun.
In my free time I'm renovating my attic and teaching web development courses at Miami University. I also have a thriving vegetable and herb garden. Work-life balance and staying on top of my health is important to me.

### 🎁 And... that's a wrap.
Those are some highlights of the work I do. Need help with a project? Don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always down to collaborate with other developers and work with awesome people on awesome projects.

💜 Alyssa
